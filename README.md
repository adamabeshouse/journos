A pro-active journal to help you measure your life

General ideas for this:

- "What did you do today?"
- It's gotta pop up without you asking for it, otherwise it doesn't work.
- If you open a terminal at night, it asks.
- If you open a terminal in the morning, it asks what did you do yesterday if you didnt open it last night.
- If you miss a day, it asks if you want to fill it in. If you say no, forgets about it.

- If you say "nothing", it says what kind of nothing? etc
- It should say about certain types of things "how did it go? how did you feel about it?"

- If an activity seems similar to one its seen before, ask if it's the same. This way we can bucket them and easier to analyze later.
Don't do this with thoughts. Just with activity names

- You should be able to ask it what to do tonight, and itll say "well you said last wednesday that you had a good time doing X" or something like that

For power users
- "what were you doing between 12 and 3? between 3 and 6? 6 and 9? 9 and 12?"
